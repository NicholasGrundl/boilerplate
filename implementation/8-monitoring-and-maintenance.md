# 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

Proper monitoring and maintenance are crucial for ensuring the reliability and performance of your issfrontend application. Here's how to set up basic monitoring and maintain your application:

## Set up Cloud Monitoring

1. Enable the Cloud Monitoring API:
   ```bash
   gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com
   ```

2. Set up a basic uptime check:
   ```bash
   gcloud monitoring uptime-check-configs create http-issfrontend \
       --display-name="issfrontend Uptime Check" \
       --http-check="https://YOUR_CLOUD_RUN_URL" \
       --period="5m"
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_CLOUD_RUN_URL` with your actual Cloud Run service URL.

3. Create an alert policy:
   ```bash
   gcloud alpha monitoring policies create \
       --display-name="issfrontend Alert Policy" \
       --condition-display-name="HTTP Uptime" \
       --condition-filter="metric.type=\"monitoring.googleapis.com/uptime_check/check_passed\" resource.type=\"uptime_url\" metric.label.\"check_id\"=\"http-issfrontend\"" \
       --condition-threshold-value=1 \
       --condition-threshold-comparison=COMPARISON_LT \
       --condition-duration=300s \
       --notification-channels="YOUR_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID"
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID` with your preferred notification channel ID.

## Set up Cloud Logging

Cloud Run automatically integrates with Cloud Logging. To view logs:

1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to Cloud Run > Services
2. Click on your `issfrontend` service
3. Click on the "LOGS" tab

You can also view logs via the command line:
```bash
gcloud run logs read --service issfrontend
```

## Regular Maintenance Tasks

1. Keep dependencies updated:
   - Regularly run `npm outdated` to check for updates
   - Update packages with `npm update` or manually update `package.json`
   - After updating, thoroughly test your application

2. Review and optimize Docker image:
   - Regularly review your Dockerfile for potential optimizations
   - Consider using multi-stage builds to reduce image size

3. Monitor and optimize Cloud Run resource usage:
   - Regularly check CPU and memory usage in the Cloud Console
   - Adjust container resource allocation as needed

4. Perform regular security audits:
   - Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities in dependencies
   - Keep your Node.js version updated
   - Regularly update your base Docker image

5. Backup strategy:
   - Ensure your source code is backed up (e.g., GitHub)
   - If you have a database, set up regular backups

## Implement Application-level Monitoring

1. Add error tracking:
   - Consider using a service like Sentry or Rollbar
   - Implement in your React app:

     ```jsx
     import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

     Sentry.init({
       dsn: "YOUR_SENTRY_DSN",
     });

     function App() {
       return (
         <Sentry.ErrorBoundary fallback={<ErrorFallback />}>
           {/* Your app components */}
         </Sentry.ErrorBoundary>
       );
     }
     ```

2. Implement performance monitoring:
   - Use the React Profiler API for performance measurements
   - Consider using a tool like New Relic or Google Analytics for more comprehensive monitoring

## Set up Automated Testing

1. Implement unit tests:
   - Use Jest and React Testing Library for component tests
   - Run tests before each deployment in your CI/CD pipeline

2. Add end-to-end tests:
   - Consider using Cypress or Selenium for e2e tests
   - Run these tests as part of your deployment process

## Create a Maintenance Schedule

1. Weekly:
   - Review logs and error reports
   - Check for dependency updates

2. Monthly:
   - Perform a full audit of dependencies
   - Review and optimize Cloud Run resource allocation

3. Quarterly:
   - Conduct a security audit
   - Review and update monitoring and alert configurations

By following these monitoring and maintenance practices, you'll ensure that your issfrontend application remains reliable, secure, and performant over time.
