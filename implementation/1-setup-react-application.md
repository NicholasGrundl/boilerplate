# 1. Set up the React Application

## Create a new React application

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.

2. Run the following command to create a new React application:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app issfrontend
   ```

3. Once the installation is complete, navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd issfrontend
   ```

## Modify the main content

1. Open the `src/App.js` file in your preferred text editor.

2. Replace the contents of `App.js` with the following code:

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import './App.css';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div className="App">
         <header className="App-header">
           <h1>Welcome to In Silico Strategy</h1>
           <p>Your data. Our models. Infinite possibilities.</p>
         </header>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

3. Save the file.

## Test the application locally

1. In the terminal, make sure you're in the `issfrontend` directory.

2. Run the following command to start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see your modified React application running.

## Prepare for production

1. When you're ready to create a production build, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will create a `build` directory with your optimized production-ready application.

2. You can test the production build locally using a static server:

   ```bash
   npx serve -s build
   ```

   This will serve your production build at `http://localhost:5000`.

Now your basic React application is set up and ready for the next steps in the deployment process.
