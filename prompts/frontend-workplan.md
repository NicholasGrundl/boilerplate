I want to host a small frontend website through google cloud platform. Im broadly familiar with the steps and technologies involved but want some expert insight on the best way to do this as well as specific guidance to get something setup quickly.

Ive included some relevant details inside of the <detail> tags. Please take a look and reflect on the <detail> and come up with an outline of all the technical steps and aspects I should carry out. Put your thoughts inside of <thinking> tags. put the implementation plan inside of <plan> tags. Adhere to the <planformat> for the <plan> structure

Finally interview me about any specific steps that are lacking or need more detail in the <plan>

<planformat>
* use markdown headers for each step in the plan
* use numbered lists for substeps inside of a plan step
* use bullets and code snippets or cells inside of substeps to convey even more detail
</planformat>

<detail> * *
* Front end is a react based app
* Want to dockerize or containerize the deployment 
* Want to use Google cloud platform including the artifact registry, cloud build, and cloud run 
* I already have a domain name that I want to connect to the website
* I will need to use some text and assets (images, animations, etc). provide options for how best to do this, either via a docker image or otherwise
* I plan to store the source code in github
<detail>

Ok that's it. Don't forget to read all the <detail> first and reflect in <thinking> tags before providing and answer.
